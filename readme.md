# Introduction to R and Rstudio

In this one day course, I will provide a comprehensive introduction to R and how it can be used for statistical data analysis.
I will begin by providing a thorough introduction to RStudio, which is the most popular and powerful interfaces for using R.
I will then introduce all the fundamentals of the R language and R environment: variables and assignment, data structures, operators, functions, scripts, packages, projects, etc.
I will end with an introduction to data processing and formatting (aka, data wrangling), an introduction to data visualization, and introduce how to some of the most widely used statistical methods such as linear regression, etc. 
From this course, you will gain a comprehensive introduction to R, which will serve as foundation for progressing further with R to any kind of data analysis, data science, or statistics.

# Course programme 

* *The What and Why of R*. We'll start by briefly explaining what R is, what is used for, and why is has become so popular.
* *Guided tour of RStudio*. RStudio is the most widely used interface to R. We will provide a tour of all its parts and features and how to use it effectively.
* *Step by step introduction to R*. Having explain what R is, and introduced RStudio, we turn to our coverage of all the fundamentals of R and the R environment. These include 
    * variables and assignment
    * vectors
    * data frames
    * functions 
    * scripts
    * installing and loading packages
    * using RStudio projects
    * reading in data, etc. 
    This topic will be detailed so that everyone obtains a solid grasp on these fundamentals, which makes all subsequent learning much easier.
* *Introduction to wrangling, visualization, statistics*. In the last section of the course, we will provide a very brief introduction to data wrangling, data visualization, and doing statistical analysis in R. These are huge topics, and so here, we just provide a brief introduction.

# Equipment and software requirements

Attendees of the course will need to use a computer on which RStudio can be installed.
This includes Mac, Windows, and Linux, but not tablets or other mobile devices.
Instructions on how to install and configure all the required software, which is all free and open source, is provided [here](software.md). 

An alternative to using a local installation of RStudio is to use RStudio cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/).
This is a free to use and full featured web based RStudio. See [here](software.md) for more details.
